WellList 🍸📦
A simple and practical way to manage bar restocking.

🧾 What is it?
In busy bars, especially during service, it's common to use paper or note apps to keep track of what needs to be restocked. But that often leads to:

Hard-to-read handwriting

Missing or outdated information

Confusing or duplicated lists

Extra work for bartenders and barbacks

WellList solves these problems with a simple interface made for real bar routines.

🍹 Made for The House Dublin (Ireland)
This app was built based on the daily workflow at The House Dublin, a busy bar with multiple wells (bar stations) and a big team working in shifts.
The goal is to make communication easier and keep everything more organized.
