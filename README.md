# WellList 🍸📦

**A smarter, cleaner way to manage bar restocking.**

## 🧾 Why this app?

In busy bars, especially during high-paced service, restocking items is often managed with pen and paper or in basic note-taking apps. While this may seem practical at first, it often leads to:

- ✍️ **Illegible handwriting**
- 📉 **Inconsistent formatting**
- 😵 **Lost or outdated information**
- 🔁 **Duplicate work between barbacks and bartenders**

**WellList** was created to solve these problems by offering a simple, mobile-friendly solution tailored for real bar environments.
